# Compiling/Installation

I won't help with Compiling this, however it's relatively easy to do it yourself if you don't trust the precompiled Binary.

Download the latest build from the releases page, and copy it into /usr/bin on your ARM computer.

Read the original Github to find how to use the tool.
